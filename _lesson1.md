# Lesson 1: Learning GitHub

## Lesson objectives 
- Create a GitHub repository.
- Create folders and files.
- Create and edit a markdown file.

## 1. Create a new GitHub repository
A repository is a container for related materials (i.e. folders and files), that allows for them to be managed (stored, version-tracked) and shared together. Usually, you create a separate repository for each project that you are working on. [Here are the New York Times' GitHub repositories](https://github.com/nytimes), for example.
- Ensure you have [created a GitHub account](preparation#2-create-a-github-account) and are logged in.
- From your GitHub main page, click on the green **New Repository** button. This is the repository (storage location) where the content of your website will be hosted. 
  - Provide a name for your repository. The name you enter will determine the URL of your repository.
    - The repository URL will take the form: ```https://github.com/<your-github-username>/<your-repo-name>```
	- e.g. ```https://github.com/jasonbrodeur/test-pages```
- Check the box to **Initialize this repository with a README**
	- **NOTE**: Your README file is a plain text file (same as a .txt file) that typically contains descriptive information about your repository (Who made it? What does it contain? What is it for?, etc.). The ```.md``` extension indicates to GitHub that this is a Markdown file (more on that later). One of the nice features of markdown files is that they are readable by almost any applications (and humans), since they are mostly just plain text files.
- Click the **Create repository** button
- Your browser will now open to the top-level page of the repository. Your repository will contain one file: **README.md**. 

## 2. Add files and folders
In this step, you'll create a file and folder in your repository and upload a file from your computer to your new folder. You will eventually use all of these items to create your first webpage with GitHub Pages 
 
### Create a new file 
- In the top-level repository page (i.e. click on the ```<> Code``` button , click ```Add file > Create new file```
- When prompted to name your file, title it ```index.md```. This creates an empty text file that GitHub will assume contains Markdown code.
- Click **Commit change**.
 
### Create a new folder 
We want to create a folder named ```docs``` in the top level of the repository. This is where the web page content will live. We also want to create a file in this folder called ```index.md```. This will be the home page for your website.

  - NOTE1: To create a file, simply enter the desired name and file extension. 
  - NOTE2: To create a folder, you need to add a trailing slash (/) to the name, and you need to [create a file within the folder](https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Creating-new-folders-in-GitHub-repository-via-the-browser), since empty folders aren't saved. You can always delete this file later.
	- In the **Name your file...** box, enter ```docs/index.md```. Click **Commit change**. You will now have a folder named ```docs``` in your repository with a file named ```index.md```.
